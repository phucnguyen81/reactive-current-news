# Create the spec (all use cases)

# Create statecharts for the app (from the spec)

# Add 'Refresh' button to the toolbar

# Show better error messages (as popup or special card?)

# Show warning if rate limit drops under a threshold

# Start/stop the control, not fetch/cancel

# Configure apiKey and language
Use local storage as data store for keeping settings

# Show app title 'Current News' as part of settings

# Add timeout for fetching news
-   Timeout for HttpClient
-   Timeout for currentsapi

# Prevent doing multiple fetches at the same time
Done at the code level, but let's do the refresh button first so that this can
be tested manually.

# 'Not again' buttons
On 'Not again', remove the news card and load
a new one in. Need to persist news cards.
